util:
WhiteNoise

To do:
Switch from white noise to S3 for user uploads
Look into the email with sntp
could integrate with plaid for a fun project
switch from allauth-ui to tailwind or custom templates - the custom elements do not work as they should - there is a problem with library and rendering the static - coping over their css is nessesery
